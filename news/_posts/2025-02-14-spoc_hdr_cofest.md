We held our second **🖖🏾SPOC CoFest**, in the great tradition of the excellent CoFests organised in the GTN that welcomed @gtn:nomadscientist and many others into the community.

This was our first live event, run as one of 12 projects in the inaugural [Health Data Research UK / ELIXIR-UK Joint Hackathon](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/research/research-data-infrastructure/hdr-uk-and-elixir-uk-hackathon/).

We welcomed a new and experienced participants, tested new tutorials, and refined the pathway from new user to new contributor - a priority for enabling community engagement and keeping our training materials updated.

We also used the excellent Maintainer page to identify and update metadata in numerous tutorials.
