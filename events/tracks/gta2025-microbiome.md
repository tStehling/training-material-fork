title: Microbiome analysis
description: This track explains the capability to analyze microbiome data using Galaxy, covering essential tasks such as amplicon analysis and its visualization. It progresses to more advanced topics, including assembly and binning - the requirements for reconstructing Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) from microbiome samples, and finally extends to complex analyses like metatranscriptome studies and pathogen detection. Start with the tutorial at your own pace. You can have a look at the program of the [GTA's 2024 Microbiome track](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/events/tracks/gta2024-microbiome.html).
