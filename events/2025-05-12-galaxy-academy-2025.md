      Kick off the week with a hands-on introduction to Galaxy, covering everything from basic navigation and data manipulation to reproducing published analyses, quality control, and mapping sequences to a reference genome. Whether you're new to Galaxy or looking to strengthen your skills, today's sessions will equip you with the foundational knowledge needed for more advanced topics.
# In the morning you can take part in the Icebreaker by joining us in the [Slack introduction channel](https://gtnsmrgsbord.slack.com/archives/C07NKAJ8THA). Or you can directly start with the tutorials.

   #       **Wednesday:** We would love to hear where you find inspiration. Maybe you find inspiration through nature or maybe you have a prominent role model in your lifeâ€”we'd love to learn more about you!
   #       **Thursday:** If you could take any one movie prop from a movie set, what would it be?

    description: |
      Over the course of these three days, you can choose your preferred track and learn how to use Galaxy for data analysis in this research field. If you find multiple topics interesting, feel free to explore more than one track. Each track will guide you through the process, from basic to more advanced analyses, to accommodate learners of all levels.

# For assistance, you can access support through the Slack channel associated with each track module. Please note that while we strive to accommodate all time zones, responses to specific questions may take a bit longer depending on the availability of experts in your time zone.
    tracks:  # Instead of tutorials, you can also define tracks, this will create a button per track that will lead to a different page

# Welcome to the Galaxy Training Academy 2025
Do you want to learn how to use Galaxy, an open source data analysis platform? Then you are at the right place. We offer here a **5-day Global Online and Asynchronous learning event**.

**Registrations will open on the 3rd of March.**  

## Do you want to join the GTA as a trainer?
Please fill out our [form](https://forms.gle/V9QqSDNg2UmQaDHy8) to indicate in what capacity you would like to help. 

## Do you want to participate as a learner?
In the following, you will learn everything you need to know about the event.

**Course format**

The event is asynchronous which means you can set your own pace on your learning journey using our provided self-learning materials. You will start the event by yourself at your preferred time.
Don't worry, asynchronous does not mean that you are alone! If you ever need help, you can contact one of our many trainers worldwide via **Slack chat**.

**How to participate**

First, you will need to register. **We will open registrations on the 3rd of March.** 
You only need a browser and an account on one of the Galaxy instances registered for this event. Please have a look at the [setup page](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/events/2025-05-12-galaxy-academy-2025.html#setup).

<button id="program-button" class="btn btn-info" onclick="$('#setup-tab').tab('show');">Setup</button>

**Content of the event**

We provide you with training materials which you can study at your own pace and on your own time throughout the week. Have a look at our [program](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/events/2025-05-12-galaxy-academy-2025.html#program). The program is still **under development**. 

<button id="program-button" class="btn btn-info" onclick="$('#program-tab').tab('show');">Program</button>

On the first day, you can make yourself familiar with the Galaxy platform. In the next days, you can follow different tracks. Please go to the program tab for more information. On Friday we offer a ***Fair training*** program to you.

**How to get help** 

You will not be alone! If you ever need help, you can contact one of our many trainers worldwide via **Slack chat**. Next to the program, you will find Slack channels you can join to exchange with the trainers and other participants during the event. Here you will also find help if you have questions or run into an issue during the training. We try to cover all time zones with helpers for each topic, but please be patient if you do not get an immediate response.


**Certificates**

You will be able to obtain a certificate by the end of the event. More information is coming soon.
