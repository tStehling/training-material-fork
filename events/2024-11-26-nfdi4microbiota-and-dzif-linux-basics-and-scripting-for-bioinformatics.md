title: 'NFDI4Microbiota and DZIF: Linux basics and scripting for bioinformatics'
description: |
  The aim of this workshop is to lay a foundation for the automated application of (bioinformatics)
  programs. Accordingly, interested biologists and physicians and other
  people interested, are invited to participate in a hands-on, in-person workshop,
  where they can become familiar with the Linux environment and its associated landscape,
  using common bioinformatics tools as examples for creating shell scripts. The last
  day of the workshop will cover the fundamentals of the Slurm job scheduler, specifically
  as used in the HZI cluster, although this material is generally applicable.

  There will also be time available to allow participants to discuss their own bioinformatics
  problems. The course assumes no Linux knowledge, and will be taught in English.
  All participants will receive a certificate of attendance.
