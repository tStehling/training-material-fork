If you find a minor mistake in any GTN training material, we encourage you to propose a correction. For small changes such as typos, this can be done from the browser. If you can implement the corrections yourself, in the context of where they happen, this saves a lot of time for the editors.  When you submit your suggestion, it will be carefully checked by an expert, so do not worry about breaking anything! 

Outline of the steps:

1. Start from the page with the minor mistake.  
2. Open the page in the GitHub editor.  
3. Make the correction.  
4. Save the changes with a description of what you did.  
5. Send the proposal to the GTN team to check, then apply the change.

In this example, we will show how to correct a typo in the metadata of a learning pathway. Note, this specific typo has now been corrected.

### 1. Start from the page with the minor mistake

![Learning pathways page]({% link faqs/gtn/images/minor-fix-01.png %} "Example of a page with a typo, this time in the page metadata")

![A training material page]({% link faqs/gtn/images/minor-fix-02.png %} "At the top a training material, click Settings then Propose a change or correction")

1. From the [learning pathways page]({% link learning-pathways/ %}), you can see the tags below each pathway. Here, one of the pathways has a tag 'introcuction', which should be 'introduction'. 
2. Click to open the page.
3. At the top-right of the page, click **Settings** then **Propose a change or correction**. This will open the page in edit mode. The training material is stored in GitHub, an external site, but we will walk you through how to navigate it.

### 2. Open the page in the GitHub editor  

![Create a fork]({% link faqs/gtn/images/minor-fix-04.png %} "You need to create a 'fork' of the training material")

1. You may be asked to sign into GitHub. If you have never used GitHub before, please [register for a free GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github).
2. You may be asked to create a fork of the GTN training materials repository. A fork is a linked copy of the training materials in your personal GitHub account. Click **Fork this repository**.

### 3. Make the correction  

![GitHub edit page]({% link faqs/gtn/images/minor-fix-06.png %} "Make your changes in the editor")

1. You will see the text that makes up the training material (it uses a language called Markdown).
2. In this example, we need to correct a line of the metadata at the top of the file (this is called the frontmatter). Type your correction.

### 4. Save the changes with a description of what you did

![Commit changes]({% link faqs/gtn/images/minor-fix-07.png %} "Give a summary and 'commit' them")

1. When you have finished making corrections, click the **Commit changes...** button. 
2. You will be asked to provide a brief summary of the changes you have made. In the box labeled **Commit message**, type a summary. 
3. You do not need to give an extended description here.
4. Click the **Propose changes** button.

### 5. Send the proposal to the GTN team to check, then apply the change

![Compare your changes]({% link faqs/gtn/images/minor-fix-08.png %} "Compare your changes")

![Make a pull request]({% link faqs/gtn/images/minor-fix-11.png %} "Send the proposal in a 'pull request'")

1. You are taken to a page titled **Comparing changes**. You will see a list of the changes you have made. This appears as lines removed (beginning with a minus sign, in red) and lines added (beginning with a plus sign, in green).
2. Click the **Create pull request** button. This will open a pull request; this is a submission of your proposal that contains all the essential information for the editors and the platform to implement and apply the correction.
3. The **title** will be the same as the commit message you typed earlier.
4. Add a **description** which describes your changes. You can include links as required.
5. Click the **Create pull request** button. Your change has now been submitted, or, in GitHub terms, you have now opened a pull request. 
6. The pull request will need to be reviewed by a human. There are also some automated checks that will be run. After all this is completed, if your request is approved, it will be applied (or 'merged' in GitHub terms).
